n 1961, Suwa Seikosha established a company called Shinshu Seiki Co. as a subsidiary to supply precision parts 
for Seiko watches. When the Seiko Group was selected to be the official time keeper for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo,
 a printing timer was required to time events, and Shinshu Seiki started developing an electronic printer.
In September 1968, Shinshu Seiki launched the world's first mini-printer, the EP-101 ("EP" for Electronic Printer,)
which was soon incorporated into many calculators. In June 1975, the name Epson was coined for the next generation 
of printers based on the EP-101 which was released to the public. (EPSON:E-P-SON: SON of Electronic Printer).
In April of the same year Epson America Inc. was established to sell printers for Shinshu Seiki Co.
